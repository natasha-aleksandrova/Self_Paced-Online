# Self Paced Online Class Repository

This is a repository used by the UWPCE Python Certificate Program Self Paced Online Class

It can be used by the class to share information and for students to submit their work.

## Structure of the Repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

`examples`: Used to put example code, etc in for the class.

`solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises

`students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create a directory in the students directory in which to put their work.



My name is William White. I like to ski, play soccer, hang out with my dogs, and travel. I currently work in finance and am hoping this course will better help me analyze data.
