Welcome to Harvey's readme! I!m so excited you!re here! This is a new computer! and the only punctuation mark I can find is the excalamtion mark! Actually! everything!s in the right place on the keyboard! I just wanted to see if I could type with only the exclamation mark! I!m also curious what it!s like to read a file that only has exclamation marks!

Time to learn some Python!
