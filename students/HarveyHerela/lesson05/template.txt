Dear {firstname} {lastname},

Thank you for your recent donation of ${amount:.2f}. Your generosity changes the lives of many people. If 
it weren't for the continuing support of courageous donors like you, the people we help would be
miserable beyond despair, doing unmentionable things in vain. Your total donations of ${total:.2f} have
touched the lives of countless folks. For what it's worth, those people at rock bottom thank you from
the bottoms of their hearts.

Yours Truly,
Local Charity Staff
