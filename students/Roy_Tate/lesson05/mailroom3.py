        Dear {0},

        First, we would like to thank you for your continued generosity throughout the 
        years. Without contributions like yours, the good things that we are able to do 
        simply would not be possible. 

        Your contributions to date have totaled ${1:.2f}. 

        This years challenge is to see if you can donate more than your current total
        in one year. This would effectively double your current donations to the 
        organization!  Remember, it is for a good cause!

        Sincerely,

        The good guys at the best organization'''
