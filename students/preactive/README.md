#Python UW cert

####Hello, My name is Michael Messmer. At the time of this writing I am a SDE with my current projects working with Front-End with JS, React on the Operations Tooling team for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in Seattle. 

####I have done a some full stack development and my preferred stack is Back-End or SRE role. I have enjoyed working with python for a number of years but mostly ad-hoc with no formal education. My favorite stack is Web2py, uWSGI, nginx, OracleDB/Sqlite3. 

####Aspirations: When I finish building my detached office this spring I will spin up an OpenStack environment and utilize my skills from the UW IoT course and retrofit my entire house with IoT connected devices and home management web dashboards.
